SUBJECT: Quick question about QPSI inventory team

---

[Boss Name],

Hope you're doing well. It's been a couple years but I've been
thinking about the work we did rescuing that 50K deficit at QPSI.

Quick context: I built a warehouse intelligence platform that
automates what I used to do manually for inventory analysis.

It analyzes WMS/Excel exports and flags the same patterns we
hunted for:
- Pallets stuck in receiving >10 hours
- Incomplete lots with stragglers
- Overcapacity scanning errors
- Invalid location scans
- All the ghosts we used to track down

Instead of spending 4-8 hours combing through spreadsheets,
the inventory team uploads the file and gets prioritized alerts
in ~2 minutes.

I'm piloting it with real warehouses now. Given QPSI's complexity
(retail packaging operations, high SKU counts, seasonal spikes),
it'd be perfect validation.

Would the inventory team be interested in testing it? Free for
3 months - I handle setup, training, everything. Just need their
honest feedback on what works and what doesn't.

My dad and brother still work there, so I know the operation's
probably evolved since I left. That's actually why I think it'd
be a great test case.

Free to chat this week if you want details.

P.S. - No pressure if timing isn't right. Just thought of you
guys first since you gave me my start in inventory management.
