Hi Mr. Keith, it's Marcos - hope you remember me 😊

I'm about to graduate with my CS degree (the one I was working
on at QPSI), and I wanted to reach out because I built something
I think you'd appreciate.

Remember all those inventory concepts you guys taught me? I turned it into
software.

It does what I used to do manually - ensures all lots moved to
the racks, catches pallets left behind in aisles or receiving,
flags overcapacity issues, invalid locations, all the patterns
we used to hunt down in Excel. But automated in 2 minutes
instead of hours.

I'm testing it with real warehouses now and immediately thought
of QPSI. You guys taught me everything I know about inventory -
would mean a lot if the team could be the first to try it.

Free pilot. I can send you a demo link first (since you're
in NJ), or if the PA team wants, I can come down in person to
walk them through it. Whatever works best.


Thanks for everything you guys taught me back then, Mr. Keith.
Really shaped how I think about operations.

- Marcos
