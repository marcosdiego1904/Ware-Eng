ROLE: Act as a QA Test Data Specialist for warehouse anomaly detection systems.

  OBJECTIVE: Create a dataset for Excel file named [test2].xlsx containing exactly
  [800] rows, where each row represents a pallet. Generate [5]
  anomalies for each specified business rule.

  WAREHOUSE LAYOUT:
  [  Warehouse Name
Warehouse DEFAULT1

Warehouse ID
DEFAULT

Structure
4 aisles × 2 racks × 46 positions × 4 levels

Level Names
ABCD

Default Capacity
1 pallet per level

Rack Type
Single (1 pallet/level)
Total Locations
1,481
1,472 storage + 9 special areas

Storage Capacity
1,541
Total pallet capacity (1,472 storage + 69 special)
Structure
4A/2R
46P × 4L per rack

  ⚠️  CRITICAL: Include capacity information for each location type:
   Example format:
  - Storage Locations: A-01-01A, A-01-01B, A-02-01A, B-01-01A, B-01-01B Default Capacity
1 pallet per level

  - Default storage capacity: [1] pallet(s) per location

  CAPACITY-AWARE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY:
  IMPORTANT: Distribute pallets respecting capacity constraints to avoid overcapacity explosion

  For storage locations with capacity=1:
  - Use MOSTLY unique locations (1 pallet per location)
  - Create INTENTIONAL overcapacity only for specific test cases
  - Target: <5% of locations should have >1 pallet

  For higher-capacity locations:
  - Distribute normally but stay under capacity limits
  - Reserve overcapacity violations for planned test scenarios

  BUSINESS RULES TO TEST:
  - ✅ STAGNANT_PALLETS (threshold: [X] hours in staging locations)threshold need more than 80% completion
  - ✅ UNCOORDINATED_LOTS (completion threshold: [X]% before flagging stragglers)
  - ✅ OVERCAPACITY ⚠️ CONTROLLED (create [X] specific violations, not random distribution)
  - ✅ INVALID_LOCATION (locations not in warehouse layout)
  - ✅ LOCATION_SPECIFIC_STAGNANT (threshold: [X] hours in AISLE locations)
  - ✅ DATA_INTEGRITY (duplicate scans + impossible location formats)
  - ✅ MISSING_LOCATION (null/empty location fields)
  - ✅ PRODUCT_INCOMPATIBILITY (restricted products in wrong zones)
  - ❌ TEMPERATURE_ZONE_MISMATCH (exclude unless specified)

  OVERCAPACITY TEST STRATEGY:
  Instead of random distribution:
  1. Create [X] specific overcapacity violations in designated locations
  2. For remaining pallets, respect capacity constraints:
     - If capacity=1: Use mostly unique storage locations
     - If capacity>1: Distribute normally but stay under limits
  3. Result: Controlled anomaly count instead of hundreds

  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Excel columns: pallet_id, receipt_number, description, location, creation_date
  - Timestamp format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
  - CAPACITY VALIDATION: Verify final distribution doesn't create unintended overcapacity
  - Generate exactly [TOTAL_PALLETS - (RULES_COUNT × ANOMALIES_PER_RULE)] valid records
  - Provide final dataset as Markdown table sample

  VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
  - Total pallet count matches target exactly
  - Overcapacity anomalies match intended count (not hundreds)
  - Storage locations mostly have ≤capacity pallets
  - Special locations respect capacity limits
  - Only planned violations exist
