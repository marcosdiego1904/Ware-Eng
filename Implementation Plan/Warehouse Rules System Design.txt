Warehouse Rules System Design for "Ware-Intelligence" - Conclusions
1. Purpose of This Document
This document consolidates the vision and strategy for the evolution of the rules system for the "Ware-Intelligence" application. The conclusions presented here are the result of combining the technical analysis of the application with expert feedback from a former inventory manager, aiming to create a system that is not only powerful but also directly aligned with the real needs and problems of warehouse management.
2. Fundamental Philosophy
The evolution of the rules system is based on a paradigm shift:
* From a Static to a Dynamic System: We are moving away from the rigid model based on an Excel file to adopt a flexible architecture managed from a database and a user interface.
* From Detection to Operational Intelligence: The goal is no longer just to "find anomalies," but to reflect the "red flags" that an experienced supervisor actively looks for every day. The system must think like an inventory manager.
* From Complexity to Intuition: The rules, although complex in their internal logic, must be created and managed by non-technical users through a visual and intuitive interface.
3. The Three Pillars Framework
To standardize and structure the warehouse logic in a way that is universally applicable, all rules will be organized under three fundamental pillars, prioritized according to their real impact on the operation:
1. Pillar 1: FLOW & TIME Rules (Maximum Priority): These define the movement and permanence of inventory. Inefficiency in flow is the main cause of the most common and serious problems.
2. Pillar 2: SPACE Rules (High Priority): These define the physical and logical structure of the warehouse. Violations of these rules are a powerful indicator of hidden problems, such as lost pallets.
3. Pillar 3: PRODUCT Rules (Medium Priority / Optional): These define the characteristics of the inventory. They are important, but their application depends on the complexity and specificity of each warehouse.
4. Breakdown of Standard Rules by Pillar
Pillar 1: FLOW & TIME Rules (Process Problems)
Rule Type
	Description & Justification (Based on Your Feedback)
	Importance Level
	Stagnant Pallets
	Problem: Pallets that remain in temporary zones for too long. <br> Justification: You confirmed that the goal is to move pallets the same day. Any pallet in RECEIVING or AISLE from the previous day is an immediate alert. The rule must be strict and configurable by zone (e.g., 6 hours in AISLE).
	Critical
	Uncoordinated Lots
	Problem: Pallets from the same lot that are left behind. <br> Justification: You described this as "one of the most common problems," often caused by not scanning upon moving. The rule that "everything moves together" is fundamental. The threshold (e.g., 80%) must be configurable.
	Critical
	Expiration Risk
	Problem: Products approaching their expiration date without being moved. <br> Justification: A natural evolution for warehouses with perishable goods. The rule would be based on the pallet's age (creation_date) and the product category.
	High
	Pillar 2: SPACE Rules (Location Problems)
Rule Type
	Description & Justification (Based on Your Feedback)
	Importance Level
	Overcapacity
	Problem: More pallets registered in a location than can physically fit. <br> Justification: You described this as "super important" and one of your main tools for "hunting down" lost pallets. If the system says there are 3 pallets in a rack with a capacity of 2, it's an unequivocal red flag that one pallet is misplaced.
	Critical
	Invalid Locations
	Problem: Pallets registered in locations that do not exist. <br> Justification: A direct consequence of scanning or typing errors. It's a basic but essential alert for maintaining the integrity of inventory data.
	High
	Idle Space Detection
	Problem/Opportunity: Locations that are below their optimal capacity. <br> Justification: Your key insight: "if a rack is for 2 and there is only 1, there is a space to be used." This transforms the app from a problem detection tool to a space optimization tool.
	High (Future Feature)
	Pillar 3: PRODUCT Rules (Compatibility Problems)
Rule Type
	Description & Justification (Based on Your Feedback)
	Importance Level
	Product-Location Incompatibility
	Problem: A product is in an area not designated for its type. <br> Justification: You confirmed that this rule is "the least important" in many environments, where storage is more opportunistic. Therefore, it should be an optional module that companies with strict requirements (e.g., chemicals, refrigerated goods) can activate.
	Medium / Optional
	5. Standard Rules Package for New Users
To provide immediate value, the application will offer a default set of rules based on the most critical and common problems you identified. A new user will start with these 4 alerts activated:
1. "Forgotten Pallets" Alert: Notifies if a pallet spends more than [ 6 ] hours in transit zones like RECEIVING or AISLE.
2. "Incomplete Lots" Alert: Notifies if more than [ 80 ]% of a lot has been stored but pallets from that lot still remain in receiving.
3. "Overcapacity" Alert: Notifies if a number of pallets greater than the physical capacity of a location is registered in the system.
4. "Invalid Locations" Alert: Notifies if a pallet is scanned into a location that does not exist in the warehouse configuration.
6. Vision for the User Interface: The "Rule Builder"
The creation of rules will be abstracted into a visual and intuitive interface that will not require technical knowledge. It will be based on a "fill-in-the-blank" model:
IF [Pallet Field ▼] [Operator ▼] [Value]
AND [Pallet Field ▼] [Operator ▼] [Value]
THEN [Generate Anomaly ▼] with priority [Priority ▼]
This approach will guide the user logically, allowing them to build complex rules simply and without ambiguity.
