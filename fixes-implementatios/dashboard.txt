  Final Refined Tab Structure (Using Your Existing Intelligence)

  Tab 1: "Action Center" (Primary Focus)

  Hero Section (5-second scan):
  - Critical Issues Today: Count with "Fix Now" urgency from your business intelligence
  - Resolution Speed: Average time (this week vs last week)
  - Active Processing: Your processing status indicators
  - Today's Progress: Resolution progress percentage from your weighted algorithm

  Actionable Intelligence (30-second scan):
  - Your "Fix Now" Category: Using your existing critical urgency classification
  - Your "Fix Today" Category: Using your high priority business logic
  - Quick Wins: Your existing data issues and single-person fixes
  - Overcapacity Breakdown: Storage vs Special locations (your existing logic)

  Action Steps (your resolution steps):
  - 1. Locate Pallet: Verify location
  - 2. Assess Issue: Determine action
  - 3. Execute Resolution: Take corrective action

  Tab 2: "Location Intelligence"

  - Location Heatmap: Visual warehouse zones
  - Your Location Hotspots: Using your existing analytics
  - Zone Performance: Your operational area breakdown (receiving, storage, picking)
  - Location Trends: This week vs last week performance

  Tab 3: "Rule Performance"

  - Most Triggered Rules: This week vs last week
  - Your Priority Distribution: VERY HIGH, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW breakdown
  - Rule Categories: Your three pillars (Flow/Time, Space, Product)
  - Resolution Effectiveness: Using your weighted resolution progress

  Tab 4: "Trends & Insights"

  - Weekly Trends: Performance metrics this week vs last week
  - Your Business Intelligence: Pull from your sophisticated analytics
  - Resolution Patterns: Most resolved anomaly types
  - Predictive Insights: Based on your trend analysis

  Key Implementation Points:

  Real-time Updates Strategy:
  - Pull from your existing business intelligence calculations
  - Use your weighted resolution progress algorithm
  - Leverage your urgency classification system
  - Surface your existing resolution steps workflow

  Actionable Recommendations (using your levels):
  - Critical (0-15 min impact): "DOCK-A: 12 stagnant pallets → Send team immediately"
  - High (1-4 hour impact): "Zone B: 8 overcapacity locations → Redistribute pallets"
  - Quick Wins: "5 data integrity fixes → 30 minutes total"

  Your Existing Priority Logic:
  VERY HIGH → Critical (red) → Fix Now
  HIGH → High (amber) → Fix Today
  MEDIUM → Medium (blue) → Fix This Week
  LOW → Low (gray) → Routine Maintenance

  Your Resolution Steps Integration:
  1. Locate Pallet → "Verify location in [location]"
  2. Assess Issue → "Determine specific action needed"
  3. Execute Resolution → "Take corrective action"

  Perfect! This Works Because:

  1. Your resolution steps are exactly the right level - general enough for overview, specific enough for action
  2. Your priority system is perfect - clear critical vs high vs medium classification
  3. Your business intelligence is sophisticated - we just need to surface it prominently
  4. Your real-time tracking works - weighted resolution progress, urgency classification
  5. This week vs last week is ideal - gives context without too much noise
