## 🔧 What This Nuclear Fix Does

### ✅ **STEP 1: Diagnoses Database**
- Lists all existing tables in your PostgreSQL database
- Identifies what's missing vs what exists

### ✅ **STEP 2: Creates ALL Missing Tables**
- `warehouse_config` - Warehouse configuration settings
- `warehouse_template` - Shareable warehouse templates  
- `rule_category` - Rule categorization (FLOW_TIME, SPACE, PRODUCT)
- `rule` - Dynamic warehouse rules
- `rule_history` - Rule version control
- `rule_template` - Rule templates
- `rule_performance` - Rule performance tracking

### ✅ **STEP 3: Fixes Location Table**
- Adds ALL missing columns:
  - `warehouse_id`, `aisle_number`, `rack_number`, `position_number`
  - `level` (properly sized as VARCHAR(10) for 'L5', 'L10', etc.)
  - `pallet_capacity`, `location_hierarchy`, `special_requirements`
  - `is_active`, `created_at`, `created_by`
- **Fixes existing column size issues** (expands `level` from VARCHAR(1) to VARCHAR(10))

### ✅ **STEP 4: Seeds Default Data**
- Creates default rule categories (FLOW_TIME, SPACE, PRODUCT)
- Sets up foundational data for the rule system
