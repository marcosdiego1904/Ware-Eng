VERSION 1: "THE MENTORSHIP CALLBACK"
-------------------------------------------

Hey [Boss Name], it's Diego - hope you remember me 😊

I'm about to graduate with my CS degree (the one I was working
on at QPSI), and I wanted to reach out because I built
something I think you'd appreciate.

Remember all those inventory concepts you guys taught me? The
ones we used to rescue that 50K deficit? I turned them into
software.

It basically does what I used to do manually - finds forgotten
pallets, incomplete lots, overcapacity issues, all the stuff
we tracked down in Excel. But automated.

I'm testing it with real warehouses now and immediately thought
of QPSI. You guys taught me everything I know about inventory -
would mean a lot if the team could be the first to try it.

Free pilot, I handle everything. Just want feedback from people
who actually know this stuff.

Would you be open to a quick call this week to chat about it?

VERSION 2: "THE HUMBLE APPROACH" (if V1 feels too forward)
-------------------------------------------

[Boss Name] - Diego here. Been a while!

Quick update: I'm finishing my CS degree and spent the last
year building warehouse software based on everything you guys
taught me at QPSI.

It automates the inventory analysis we used to do manually -
finding stagnant pallets, lot stragglers, all those patterns
we hunted for.

Thought of you because the concepts in the app are literally
the same ones we used to fix that 50K deficit. You'd recognize
them immediately.

I'm looking for a warehouse to pilot it with. Would QPSI's
inventory team be interested in testing it out? Free for
3 months - just need honest feedback.

Let me know if you'd be open to a quick call to discuss.

VERSION 3: "THE DIRECT PERSONAL" (most authentic to your voice)
-------------------------------------------

Hey [Boss Name], Diego here 👋

Hope you're doing well. I'm about to graduate with my CS degree
and wanted to share something with you.

I built inventory software using all the concepts you guys
taught me when I was 19-21 at QPSI. Basically automated the
system we used to recover that 50K - finds forgotten pallets,
incomplete lots, overcapacity, all of it.

I'm testing it with warehouses now and you were my first
thought. The app literally uses the same principles you
taught me, just automated.

Would the QPSI inventory team want to pilot it? Free for
3 months, I train them on it, just need feedback.

Can I call you this week to walk through it?

Thanks for everything you taught me back then.

Diego
