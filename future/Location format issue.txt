 📋 Location Format Issue Documentation

  🔍 Problem Statement:

  The warehouse anomaly detection system experienced catastrophic failure when processing test data due to location
  format incompatibility.

  Issue Details:

  Symptoms:
  - 1,612 false positive "Invalid Location" alerts (5,273% over expected)
  - 2,236 total anomalies detected vs 240 expected
  - 58% of processing time consumed by location validation failures
  - System credibility destroyed by overwhelming false alerts

  Root Cause:
  Test Data Generated:    A-01-01A, B-02-32B, E-01-16C
  System Expected:       1-01-01A, 2-02-31B, 4-02-22D

  Format Mismatch:
  • Aisle Identifiers: Letters (A-E) vs Numbers (1-4)
  • Position Range: 01-63 vs 01-42
  • Total Warehouse: 5×2×63×4 = 2,520 vs 4×2×42×4 = 1,344 locations

  Technical Impact:
  - VirtualInvalidLocationEvaluator rejected all alphabetic aisle identifiers
  - Cascade failure prevented proper capacity validation
  - Processing bottleneck in location format validation

  ✅ Solution Implementation:

  Data Generation Corrections:
  # Before (FAILED)
  self.aisles = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
  self.positions = [f"{i:02d}" for i in range(1, 64)]  # 01-63

  # After (SUCCESS)
  self.aisles = ['1', '2', '3', '4']
  self.positions = [f"{i:02d}" for i in range(1, 43)]  # 01-42

  Results After Correction:
  - Invalid Location alerts: 1,612 → 11 (99.3% reduction)
  - Total processing time: 17.91s → 15.30s (15% improvement)
  - System now properly recognizes standard location formats

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  This demonstrates the critical importance of schema validation in data integration. A simple alphanumeric vs
  numeric difference created a complete system failure. The solution required understanding the target system's
  expected data format and aligning the test data generator accordingly.
