 üìã Overcapacity Rule Analysis & Enhancement Documentation

  Executive Summary

  This document outlines a strategic enhancement to the overcapacity detection system, transforming it from a single monolithic rule into a differentiated detection framework that provides
  business-context-aware alerting and opens opportunities for premium warehouse intelligence features.

  ---
  1. Current System Analysis

  Current Overcapacity Rule Behavior

  - Detection Method: Flags ALL individual pallets in overcapacity locations
  - Application: Universal across all location types (storage + special)
  - Alert Volume: High granularity for all locations
  - Business Logic: Technically accurate but operationally inefficient

  Identified Issues

  - Alert Fatigue: Special area operations generate excessive alerts
  - Priority Dilution: Critical storage violations buried in operational noise
  - Operator Confusion: Same alert type for different business scenarios
  - Missed Business Intelligence: No differentiation between location purposes

  2. Storage vs Special Location Differentiation Strategy

  üèóÔ∏è Location Type Classification

‚óè | Location Type        | Storage Locations                | Special Locations                 |
  |----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Pattern              | X-XX-XXX (e.g., 1-01-01A)        | NAME-XX (e.g., RECV-01, AISLE-01) |
  | Capacity             | Typically 1 pallet               | 2-10+ pallets                     |
  | Purpose              | Fixed inventory positions        | Transitional/processing areas     |
  | Business Criticality | üî¥ CRITICAL - Inventory accuracy | üü° OPERATIONAL - Space management |
  | Overcapacity Impact  | Data integrity crisis            | Workflow efficiency concern       |
  | Required Action      | Investigate ALL pallets          | Monitor area, expedite processing |

  üîß Differentiated Alert Strategy

  Rule 1: Critical Storage Overcapacity
  Rule Name: "Storage Location Accuracy Alert"
  Target Locations: Storage locations (pattern: X-XX-XXX)
  Alert Strategy: Individual pallet alerts (maintain current behavior)
  Priority Level: CRITICAL üî¥
  Sample Alerts:
    - "PLT-001 in overcapacity storage 1-01-01A (2/1 pallets)"
    - "PLT-002 in overcapacity storage 1-01-01A (2/1 pallets)"
  Business Justification: Inventory accuracy requires investigation of every pallet

  Rule 2: Special Area Capacity Management
  Rule Name: "Operational Area Capacity Monitor"
  Target Locations: Special areas (RECV-, AISLE-, STAGE-, DOCK-)
  Alert Strategy: Single location-level alert per area
  Priority Level: WARNING üü°
  Sample Alerts:
    - "AISLE-01 at 130% capacity (13/10 pallets) - expedite processing"
    - "RECV-01 at 120% capacity (12/10 pallets) - monitor intake flow"
  Business Justification: Space management focus, no individual pallet investigation needed

  üìä Expected Alert Volume Impact

  | Metric              | Current System | Differentiated System | Improvement        |
  |---------------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
  | Total Alerts        | 48 alerts      | ~14 alerts            | 71% reduction      |
  | Storage Alerts      | 10 individual  | 10 individual         | Same (appropriate) |
  | Special Area Alerts | 38 individual  | 4 location-level      | 90% reduction      |
  | Operator Focus      | Diluted        | Clear priority        | Improved           |

  ‚òÖ Business Value: Clear separation of critical inventory issues from operational space management, enabling faster response to actual problems.
