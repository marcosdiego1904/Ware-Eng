  Comprehensive Smart Capacity Feature Documentation

  Feature Name: Intelligent Capacity Analytics

  Executive Summary:

  Advanced statistical analysis that goes beyond simple capacity violations to identify operational patterns, predict capacity needs, and provide strategic insights for warehouse optimization.

  Technical Specifications:

  Core Algorithm:
  # Statistical Model Components
  utilization_rate = total_pallets / total_warehouse_capacity
  expected_overcapacity = calculate_statistical_distribution(utilization_rate)
  anomaly_threshold = statistical_deviation_analysis(warehouse_patterns)
  capacity_anomalies = identify_statistical_outliers(location_data)

  Detection Logic:
  1. Warehouse-wide Utilization Analysis
    - Calculates global utilization rate (e.g., 101.5%)
    - Determines expected vs. actual overcapacity distribution
    - Identifies statistical anomalies in capacity patterns
  2. Pattern Recognition Engine
    - Analyzes location clustering patterns
    - Identifies systematic capacity violations
    - Detects operational inefficiencies through data analysis
  3. Anomaly Severity Classification
  anomaly_severity_ratio = actual_overcapacity / expected_overcapacity
  categories = ['Normal', 'Attention', 'Investigation Required', 'Critical Pattern']

  Business Value Propositions:

  For Operations Managers:
  - Predictive Capacity Planning: "You'll need 15% more space in 3 months based on trends"
  - Process Optimization: "Pick efficiency down 12% due to capacity clustering in Aisle 2"
  - Resource Allocation: "Redistribute inventory to improve flow by 23%"

  For C-Suite Executives:
  - Strategic Planning: Capacity expansion ROI analysis
  - Cost Optimization: Identify underutilized expensive storage areas
  - Performance Metrics: Warehouse efficiency benchmarking

  For Data Analysts:
  - Historical Trends: 6-month capacity utilization patterns
  - Correlation Analysis: Capacity vs. operational efficiency metrics
  - Predictive Modeling: Seasonal capacity demand forecasting
