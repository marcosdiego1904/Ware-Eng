These are the ones I liked, analized how achivable and easy to implement they're:

Operational Rhythm Analysis:

 Day-of-Week Patterns: Are Mondays worse than Fridays?
  - Seasonal Trends: How warehouse performance changes over months
 Location Personality Profiles:
  - High-Maintenance Locations: Spots that require constant attention
  - Golden Locations: Most efficient, problem-free spots
  - Transit Hubs: Locations that see the most inventory flow
  - Dead Zones: Locations that rarely get used
  - Error Magnets: Locations that consistently cause scanning problems
Process Efficiency Metrics:
  - Resolution Speed: How quickly different types of problems get fixed
  - Rule Effectiveness Rankings: Which rules provide the most value
  - False Positive Analysis: Rules that trigger unnecessarily
  - Processing Efficiency: System performance under different loads
  - Resource Utilization: How well warehouse space and systems are used

  Cool Factor: "Warehouse Health Score" - overall efficiency rating

Anomaly Severity Trending: Are problems getting worse or better?
