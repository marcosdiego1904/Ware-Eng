● 5. Technical Implementation Considerations

  🔧 System Architecture Changes

  Location Classification Engine
  class LocationClassifier:
      @staticmethod
      def classify_location(location: str) -> LocationType:
          if re.match(r'^\d-\d{2}-\d{2}[A-D]$', location):
              return LocationType.STORAGE
          elif location.startswith(('RECV-', 'AISLE-', 'STAGE-', 'DOCK-')):
              return LocationType.SPECIAL
          return LocationType.UNKNOWN

  Differentiated Alert Generation
  class AdvancedOvercapacityEvaluator:
      def generate_alerts(self, overcapacity_locations):
          alerts = []
          for location, pallets in overcapacity_locations.items():
              location_type = LocationClassifier.classify_location(location)

              if location_type == LocationType.STORAGE:
                  # Individual pallet alerts for storage locations
                  for pallet in pallets:
                      alerts.append(self.create_storage_alert(pallet, location))

              elif location_type == LocationType.SPECIAL:
                  # Single location alert for special areas
                  alerts.append(self.create_special_area_alert(location, pallets))

          return alerts
