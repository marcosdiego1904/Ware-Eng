# Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

## âœ… Completed Security Fixes

- [x] **Secret Key Management**: Removed hardcoded secret keys, now requires environment variables
- [x] **File Upload Security**: Added file type validation, size limits, and MIME type checking
- [x] **Environment Variables**: Created .env.example with all required variables
- [x] **Documentation**: Added security notes and deployment instructions
- [x] **GitIgnore**: Comprehensive .gitignore prevents committing sensitive files
- [x] **Error Handling**: Basic error handling implemented

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### Before Public Repository
- [ ] **Clean up Python packages**: Remove all packages from `/backend/src/` directory
- [ ] **Set environment variables**: Ensure `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` is set with a strong 32+ character string
- [ ] **Test without fallbacks**: Verify application fails gracefully without environment variables

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] **Database Migration**: Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL or MySQL
- [ ] **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure all traffic uses HTTPS
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Implement HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] **Logging**: Implement structured logging for security monitoring

## ðŸŸ¡ High Priority Security Improvements

- [ ] **Input Validation**: Add comprehensive input sanitization to all endpoints
- [ ] **Authentication Storage**: Move JWT tokens from localStorage to httpOnly cookies
- [ ] **CORS Restriction**: Limit CORS to specific production domains only
- [ ] **File Storage**: Move uploads to secure cloud storage (AWS S3, etc.)
- [ ] **Database Security**: Use connection pooling and encrypted connections

## ðŸŸ¢ Recommended Improvements

- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Implement unit and integration tests (aim for 80%+ coverage)
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Implement application performance monitoring
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Set up automated database backups
- [ ] **Container Security**: Create secure Docker configurations

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Required for startup
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-minimum-32-characters

# Optional with defaults
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/database.db
UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE=10485760
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=xlsx,xls
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api/v1
```

## Production Deployment Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**: All required variables must be set
2. **Database Setup**: Create production database and run migrations
3. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS is properly configured
4. **Security Headers**: Configure web server with security headers
5. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring systems
6. **Backup**: Configure automated backup systems
7. **Testing**: Run full test suite against production environment

## Security Audit Recommendations

- Conduct penetration testing before production launch
- Regular security audits (quarterly recommended)
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Implement intrusion detection systems
