### Template 1: Warm Connection (You've Met Before)

```
Hey [First Name],

Hope you're doing well at [Company]!

Quick question: Does your team still spend hours every day analyzing inventory reports in Excel, hunting for stagnant pallets and overcapacity issues?

I built something that automates that entire process (turns 3 hours into 30 seconds) and I'd love to get your honest feedback on it.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute demo? I'll show you exactly how it works, and you can tell me if I'm onto something or completely off base.

No sales pitch - just genuinely want input from someone who lives this daily.

Sound good?

[Your Name]
```

### Template 2: Cold Connection Request

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm building a tool specifically for warehouse operations managers like yourself, and I'd love to connect and get your perspective on a problem I'm trying to solve.

Looking forward to connecting!

[Your Name]
```

*Once they accept, wait 24 hours, then send:*

```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

I noticed you manage warehouse operations at [Company]. I built a tool that automates the daily inventory analysis your team probably spends 2-3 hours doing in Excel.

It catches stagnant pallets, overcapacity violations, and incomplete lots automatically - in about 30 seconds.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute demo? I'll show you exactly how it works, and you can tell me if it would actually be useful for your operation.

Worth 10 minutes of your time?

[Your Name]
```

### Template 3: Problem-Focused Hook

```
[First Name] - quick question:

How many hours does your team spend each week manually analyzing inventory reports looking for:
- Stagnant pallets in RECEIVING
- Overcapacity violations
- Incomplete lots
- Location mapping errors

I built a tool that automates that entire process. Turns 2-3 hours into 30 seconds.

One warehouse caught 12 forgotten pallets in week 1 (each worth $5K-$10K) that would have been lost for weeks using their manual process.

Want to see how it works? 10-minute demo, no sales pitch.

Reply "Show me" if you're curious.

[Your Name]

### Template 4: Case Study Hook

```
Hi [First Name],

Just helped a 3PL warehouse save 15+ hours per week on inventory analysis.

They were spending 2-3 hours daily in Excel hunting for stagnant pallets, overcapacity issues, incomplete lots. Now it takes 30 seconds.

Caught a $20K+ lost pallet issue in week 1 that they would have missed for weeks.

If your team does daily inventory analysis, would you be open to a quick demo? I'll show you exactly how it works (10 minutes max).

Worth a look?

[Your Name]
```

### Template 5: Direct & Honest

```
[First Name],

I'm reaching out cold because you manage warehouse ops at [Company] and I built something I think could save your team 15+ hours per week.

The elevator pitch:
Your team spends hours in Excel hunting for inventory issues. My tool automates it - 30 seconds instead of 3 hours.

I'm not selling anything yet. I'm validating demand with real warehouse managers.

If you're willing to give me 15 minutes of honest feedback on a demo, I'll show you exactly how it works.

Interested?

[Your Name]

P.S. If you're not the right person, who on your team handles daily inventory analysis? Happy to connect with them instead.

## EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Email 1: Problem-Solution-Proof

**Subject:** Save 15 hours/week on inventory analysis?

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because you manage warehouse operations at [Company], and I built something specifically for people in your role.

THE PROBLEM YOU PROBABLY HAVE:
Your team spends 2-3 hours every day analyzing inventory reports in Excel, manually hunting for:
- Stagnant pallets sitting in RECEIVING too long
- Overcapacity violations causing damaged goods
- Incomplete lots with missing pieces
- Location mapping errors

Sound familiar?

THE SOLUTION:
I built a system that automates that entire analysis process:
- Upload your daily inventory file
- System analyzes it against your custom rules (5 seconds)
- Get a prioritized list of actionable issues (30 seconds total)

EARLY RESULTS:
- One warehouse is saving 15+ hours per week per person
- Another caught 12 stagnant pallets in week 1 (worth $50K+ combined)
- All of them say "we should have had this years ago"

WHAT I'M ASKING:
Would you be open to a 10-minute demo?

I'll show you exactly how it works (using sample data or your own files if you want). No sales pitch - I genuinely want feedback from someone who deals with this problem daily.

Reply with "Show me" and I'll send over times to chat.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's a 3-minute video showing exactly how it works: [Loom Link]
```

### Email 2: Loss Prevention Angle

**Subject:** Prevent $50K lost pallet disasters?

```
[First Name],

Quick question: When was the last time your warehouse discovered a pallet that had been "lost" for days or weeks?

How much did that cost you in:
- Labor (multiple people searching)
- Damaged/expired goods
- Customer service headaches
- Leadership meetings about "how did this happen?"

I built a tool that catches these issues BEFORE they become emergencies.

It automatically scans your daily inventory files and flags:
- Pallets sitting in RECEIVING 5+ days
- Overcapacity violations (before damage occurs)
- Incomplete lots (before customer complains)
- Location errors (before someone spends 2 hours searching)

One warehouse caught a $20K+ issue in week 1 that would have been lost for weeks using their manual Excel process.

Want to see how it works?

10-minute demo, no commitment. I'll show you exactly what it catches and how much time it saves.

Reply if you're interested, or forward this to whoever handles your daily inventory analysis.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Email 3: Time Savings Angle

**Subject:** Turn 3 hours of Excel work into 30 seconds?

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm going to make a guess about your warehouse operation:

Someone on your team (maybe you, maybe a supervisor) spends 2-3 hours EVERY DAY staring at Excel spreadsheets with thousands of rows, manually hunting for:
- Stagnant inventory
- Overcapacity issues
- Incomplete shipments
- Location errors

Am I right?

If so, I built something that will blow your mind:

Upload that Excel file → System analyzes it in 5 seconds → Get a prioritized list of exactly what needs attention.

That 2-3 hours becomes 30 seconds.

Your supervisor goes from "Excel hunter" to "proactive manager."

Want to see it in action?

I'll do a 10-minute demo and you can tell me if I'm crazy or onto something. No sales pitch, just want honest feedback from someone in the trenches.

Reply with "Demo" and I'll send times.

[Your Name]

P.S. The warehouses using this are saving 15+ hours per week per person. What would your team do with that time back?
```

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES

### Follow-Up 1 (3 days after initial message)

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my message from [Day].

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short:

I built a tool that automates daily inventory analysis (turns 2-3 hours into 30 seconds).

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute demo?

If not, totally fine - just let me know and I won't bug you again.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Follow-Up 2 (7 days after initial message)

```
[First Name],

Last message from me, I promise.

I wanted to share this quick video showing exactly what I built:
[Loom Link - 3 minutes]

It shows how warehouse managers are using this to save 15+ hours per week on inventory analysis.

If it looks interesting, reply and I'll send you times for a quick demo.

If not, no worries - I'll stop reaching out.

Either way, hope you have a great week.

[Your Name]
```

---

### Follow-Up 3 (Different angle - 14 days after initial)

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm doing some research on warehouse inventory management challenges.

Quick question: What's the most frustrating part of your daily inventory analysis process?

(Not a sales pitch - genuinely curious what warehouse managers struggle with most.)

If you have 30 seconds to reply, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## DEMO CALL SCRIPTS

### Opening (First 2 Minutes)

```
"Hey [Name], thanks for making time. I know your time is valuable, so I'm going to keep this tight.

Here's what I'm going to do in the next 10 minutes:

1. I'm going to show you exactly what this tool does (3 minutes)
2. I'll show you a real example with sample data (3 minutes)
3. We'll talk about whether it would work for your operation (4 minutes)

Sound good?

Before I jump in - tell me quickly: How does your team currently handle daily inventory analysis? Who does it, how long does it take, what are they looking for?"

[LISTEN CAREFULLY - This is gold]
```

---

### The Demo (5 Minutes)

```
"Perfect. So here's what we built:

[SHARE SCREEN]

Step 1: You upload your daily inventory file - Excel or CSV, whatever your WMS exports.

Step 2: The system analyzes it against your custom rules. These rules are things like:
- Flag any pallet sitting in RECEIVING for more than 5 days
- Flag any location that's over 90% capacity
- Flag any incomplete lots (shipment is partial)
- Flag any location mapping errors

You can create these rules yourself in the visual builder - no coding needed.

Step 3: You get this dashboard showing:
- Total issues found
- Breakdown by severity
- Location heatmap (where problems are concentrated)
- Priority list of exactly what needs attention today

[SHOW ACTUAL EXAMPLE]

See this? This file has 5,000 rows. Took 5 seconds to analyze.

Here's what it found:
- 8 pallets in RECEIVING for 6+ days (these are your stagnant inventory)
- 3 locations over capacity
- 2 incomplete lots
- 4 location mapping errors

Your supervisor would have spent 2-3 hours finding these manually, IF they caught them all.

Now they just click through this list and handle them one by one.

That's it. That's the tool.

What do you think?"

[PAUSE - Let them talk]
```

---

### Discovery Questions (4 Minutes)

```
After demo, ask:

1. "Does this solve a problem you actually have?" (Yes/No)

2. "How much time would this save your team each week?" (Get specific number)

3. "What would your team DO with that time back?" (Find the real value)

4. "What would prevent you from using something like this?" (Surface objections early)

5. "If this worked exactly as I showed, would it be worth $999/month to you?" (Gauge budget)

6. "What would you need to see to make this a no-brainer?" (Feature gaps)
```

---

### The Close (2 Minutes)

**If they're interested:**

```
"I love that you see the value. Here's what I'm offering to the first 10 warehouses:

30-day pilot for $499 (50% off normal pricing).

I'll personally help you set it up, train your team, and we'll run it on your actual data.

After 30 days, you tell me if it's worth continuing at $999/month.

If yes, we continue. If no, you cancel - no hard feelings.

The only thing I ask: Give me honest feedback and let me use your results as a case study (I can anonymize it if you prefer).

Does that sound fair?"
```

**If they're hesitant:**

```
"I get it - you want to think about it. Totally fair.

How about this: Let's do a completely free 30-day pilot. Zero cost.

I'll set everything up, you use it for a month, and at the end you tell me if it's worth $999/month.

If yes, we sign a contract starting month 2.
If no, we part ways as friends.

All I ask: Give me 2 hours of your team's time over the month (setup + check-ins) and honest feedback.

Would that work?"
```

---

### Handling Objections

**Objection: "Our WMS should do this already"**

```
"You're right - ideally it would. But does it?

Most WMS systems are built by IT for IT. They're data dumps, not actionable intelligence.

This is built by a warehouse guy for warehouse guys. It speaks your language and shows you exactly what needs attention TODAY.

Want to try it for 30 days and see if it catches things your WMS isn't catching?"
```

---

**Objection: "Too expensive"**

```
"I get it. Let me break down the math:

If this saves your supervisor 15 hours per week, that's:
- 60 hours per month
- At $50/hour (loaded cost) = $3,000 per month saved

You're paying $999/month, saving $3,000/month.

That's a 3x ROI on labor savings alone - not counting the $5K-$50K pallet losses it prevents.

Does that math work for you?"
```

---

**Objection: "We need to think about it"**

```
"Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about?

[Listen to real objection, then address it]

How about this: Let's schedule a follow-up for next week. Between now and then:
- I'll send you a detailed ROI breakdown
- You talk to your team
- You send me any questions

Sound good?"
```

---

**Objection: "We don't have budget right now"**

```
"When does your budget reset? (Get specific date)

And just to clarify: If you DID have budget today, would you buy this?"

[If yes]: "Okay, let's do a free pilot now, and we'll time the contract to start when your budget resets. That way you can show your CFO exactly how much you're saving when you request the budget."

[If no]: "Fair enough. What would need to change for this to be worth the investment?"
```
