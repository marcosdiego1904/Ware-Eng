# 90-DAY VALIDATION PLAN: WARE-ENG
## Go/No-Go Decision Framework

**Start Date:** [Fill in when you start]
**End Date:** [90 days from start]
**Decision Deadline:** [Day 90]

---

## THE GOAL

**Primary Objective:** Get **3-5 warehouse managers** to say **"I will pay for this"** after seeing a demo.

**Success = Keep Going:**
- 3-5 qualified prospects commit to:
  - Paid pilot ($500-$999/month), OR
  - Free pilot with signed agreement to convert to paid within 30 days, OR
  - Clear "we'll buy this when X feature is added" (specific, not vague)

**Failure = Shut It Down:**
- Lots of "interesting but..." responses
- "We'll think about it" with no follow-up
- No one willing to commit even to a free pilot
- Less than 3 serious conversations about purchasing

#### Week 2: Prepare Your Pitch & Demo

**Day 8-10: Create Your 3-Minute Demo**

Your demo should follow this structure:

**1. The Hook (30 seconds)**
> "I'm going to show you something that turns 3 hours of daily inventory analysis into 30 seconds, and catches costly pallet losses before they become emergencies."

**2. The Problem (30 seconds)**
> "Right now, you or your team spend hours every day in Excel hunting for stagnant pallets, incomplete lots, overcapacity issues. And by the time you find them manually, they're already costing you money. Last week alone, how many hours did your team spend analyzing inventory reports?"

**3. The Demo (90 seconds)**
- Show: Upload a sample inventory CSV
- Show: System analyzes in 5 seconds
- Show: Dashboard with priority anomalies
- Show: Specific alerts (stagnant pallet in RECEIVING for 8 days, location overcapacity by 30%)
- Show: "This would have taken your supervisor 2-3 hours to find manually"

**4. The Value (30 seconds)**
> "This saves your team 15+ hours per week and catches problems like [specific example from demo] before they cost you $10K-$50K. We have warehouses using this daily who say it's caught issues they would have missed for weeks."

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create a **Loom video** of your demo (3 minutes max)
- [ ] Prepare **sample data** that shows impressive results
- [ ] Write your **demo script** (what you'll say on calls)
- [ ] Test your demo 3 times with a friend/family member
- [ ] Create a **1-page PDF** showing before/after (Excel nightmare → Clean dashboard)

**Day 11-14: Write Your Outreach Messages**

**LinkedIn Message Template (Warm Connection):**
```
Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! Quick question - does your team still spend hours every day analyzing inventory reports in Excel looking for stagnant pallets, overcapacity issues, etc.?

I built something that automates that entire process (turns 3 hours into 30 seconds) and I'd love to get your feedback. It's designed specifically for warehouse ops managers.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute demo? I'll show you exactly how it works and you can tell me if I'm crazy or onto something.

No sales pitch - just genuinely want feedback from someone who lives this problem daily.

[Your Name]
```

**LinkedIn Message Template (Cold Outreach):**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you manage warehouse operations at [Company]. Quick question:

Does your team spend hours every day manually analyzing inventory reports in Excel hunting for stagnant pallets, overcapacity issues, and incomplete lots?

I built a tool that automates that entire analysis process - turns 2-3 hours into 30 seconds. It's caught $20K+ pallet losses in week 1 for some warehouses.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute demo? Happy to show you exactly how it works (no sales pitch, just want feedback from someone in the trenches).

Worth 10 minutes?

[Your Name]
```

**Email Template (If You Have Email):**
```
Subject: Save 15+ hours/week on inventory analysis?

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because you manage warehouse operations at [Company], and I built something specifically for people in your role.

The Problem:
Your team probably spends 2-3 hours every day analyzing inventory reports in Excel, hunting for:
- Stagnant pallets in RECEIVING
- Overcapacity violations
- Incomplete lots
- Location mapping errors

The Solution:
I built a system that automates that entire process. Upload your daily inventory file → get a prioritized list of actionable issues in 30 seconds.

Early Results:
- Warehouses are saving 15+ hours per week per person
- Catching $10K-$50K pallet issues before they become emergencies
- One warehouse caught 12 stagnant pallets in week 1 (would have been lost for weeks otherwise)

Would you be open to a 10-minute demo?

I'll show you exactly how it works (using sample data or your own if you want). No sales pitch - I genuinely want feedback from someone who deals with this daily.

Reply with "Show me" and I'll send over a time to chat.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's a 3-minute video showing exactly how it works: [Loom Link]
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Write 3 versions of each outreach template (test different hooks)
- [ ] Get feedback from someone on your messaging
- [ ] Set up **Calendly** for easy scheduling (15-min and 30-min options)

---

### **WEEK 3-6: OUTREACH SPRINT** (Days 15-42)
*Goal: Get 20 demos scheduled*

**Daily Targets:**
- **10 outreach messages per day** (LinkedIn + email)
- **2 follow-ups per day** (people who didn't respond)
- **1-2 demo calls per day** (as they start booking)

**The Outreach Cadence:**

**Day 1:** LinkedIn connection request (if not connected) + personalized note
**Day 3:** If accepted, send demo offer message
**Day 7:** Follow-up if no response
**Day 14:** Final follow-up (different angle)
**Day 15:** Move to "No Response" column

**Tracking Your Metrics:**

Create a simple tracker:
- **Outreach Sent:** Target 10/day = 280 total over 28 days
- **Responses:** Track % (good = 15-25%)
- **Demos Booked:** Target 20 total
- **Demos Completed:** Track show-up rate (expect 60-70%)
- **Intent to Purchase:** This is the golden metric

**Weekly Goals:**

| Week | Outreach | Demos Booked | Demos Completed | Intent Signals |
|------|----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 3    | 50       | 3-5          | 2-3             | 0-1            |
| 4    | 50       | 5-7          | 4-5             | 0-2            |
| 5    | 50       | 6-8          | 5-6             | 1-3            |
| 6    | 50       | 6-8          | 5-6             | 1-3            |

**Action Items (Weekly):**
- [ ] **Monday:** Plan this week's outreach (50 messages)
- [ ] **Tuesday-Thursday:** Execute outreach (10/day)
- [ ] **Wednesday-Friday:** Demo calls (schedule for these days)
- [ ] **Friday:** Review metrics, adjust messaging if needed

**What to Track During Demos:**

After each demo, immediately record:
1. **Interest Level:** Hot (wants to buy), Warm (interested but needs more), Cold (not interested)
2. **Objections:** What concerns did they raise?
3. **Feature Gaps:** What features did they ask for?
4. **Buying Timeline:** When would they want to start?
5. **Budget Authority:** Can they sign a $999/month contract?
6. **Next Steps:** What did you agree to do next?

---

### **WEEK 7-10: CONVERSION & PILOTS** (Days 43-70)
*Goal: Convert warm leads into commitments*

By now, you should have:
- 12-15 demos completed
- 3-8 "warm" prospects (showed real interest)
- 1-3 "hot" prospects (talked about pricing, timelines)

**Your Focus Shifts to CLOSING:**

**The Pilot Offer (Your Main Close):**

```
"Here's what I'm offering to the first 10 warehouses:

30-Day Pilot for $499 (50% off our normal pricing)

What you get:
- Full system access (unlimited analysis)
- I'll personally help you set up your custom rules
- We'll analyze your actual inventory files
- You'll see exactly how much time/money you save
- After 30 days, if it's working, you continue at $999/month
- If it's not worth it, you cancel (no hard feelings)

The catch: I need you to give me honest feedback and let me use your results as a case study (anonymously if you prefer).

Sound fair?"
```

**The Free Pilot Offer (For High-Value Prospects Who Hesitate):**

```
"Let's do this:

Free 30-day pilot. Zero cost.

I'll set everything up, train your team, and we'll run it alongside your current process.

At the end of 30 days, you tell me:
- How many hours it saved you
- How many issues it caught that you would have missed
- Whether it's worth $999/month

If you say yes, we sign a contract starting month 2.
If you say no, we part ways as friends.

All I ask: Give me honest feedback and 2 hours of your team's time over the 30 days.

Deal?"
```

**Action Items (Weeks 7-10):**
- [ ] Send pilot proposals to your 5 warmest prospects
- [ ] Schedule "decision calls" with anyone who's interested
- [ ] Set up pilot accounts (onboard them personally)
- [ ] Continue outreach (10/day) to keep pipeline full
- [ ] Document EVERYTHING (their feedback, their results, their reactions)

**Weekly Check-ins:**

| Week | Active Pilots | Signed Commitments | New Demos | Pipeline Status |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 7    | 1-2           | 0-1               | 3-4       | Building        |
| 8    | 2-3           | 1-2               | 3-4       | Healthy         |
| 9    | 3-5           | 1-3               | 2-3       | Converting      |
| 10   | 3-5           | 2-4               | 2-3       | Decision time   |

---

---

**Week 12: Make Your Decision**

**THE GO/NO-GO FRAMEWORK:**

### ✅ **KEEP GOING IF:**

You have **3-5 commitments** (paid pilots or signed agreements) AND one of these:

- [ ] **Strong Signal:** Multiple prospects said "We need this, we'll pay for it"
- [ ] **Clear Path:** You can see exactly how to get to 20 customers (same playbook, scale it up)
- [ ] **Founder Energy:** You're EXCITED about the conversations, the market, the problem
- [ ] **Reasonable CAC:** Cost to acquire each customer is <$2,000 (your time + tools)
- [ ] **Feature Clarity:** Objections are specific feature requests (not "we don't need this")

**What to Do Next:**
1. Double down on outreach (scale to 20/day)
2. Hire a part-time SDR or VA to help with outreach
3. Build the top 3 requested features
4. Set a new goal: 10 paying customers in next 90 days

---

### 🟡 **PIVOT IF:**

You have **1-2 commitments** but discovered something important:

- [ ] **Wrong Market:** Different customer type showed WAY more interest
- [ ] **Different Problem:** They wanted to buy, but for a different use case
- [ ] **Pricing Issue:** Everyone loved it but price was too high (or too low)
- [ ] **Partnership Path:** WMS vendor wants to acquire/partner instead of you selling direct

**What to Do Next:**
1. Analyze what worked (who said yes and why)
2. Redesign around the ACTUAL demand you found
3. Run another 90-day test with new positioning
4. Consider co-founder or partnership to accelerate

---

### 🛑 **SHUT IT DOWN IF:**

You have **0-1 commitments** and one of these:

- [ ] **No Urgency:** Everyone said "interesting but not urgent"
- [ ] **No Budget:** Multiple prospects said "we can't afford this"
- [ ] **No Pain:** "We're fine doing it manually" was common response
- [ ] **Feature Hell:** Every prospect wanted completely different features (no pattern)
- [ ] **Founder Burnout:** You hated every sales call and can't imagine doing this for 2 years
- [ ] **Better Opportunity:** You have a job offer or other business idea that's clearly better

**What to Do Next:**
1. Write a post-mortem (what you learned)
2. Reach out to prospects who showed ANY interest and offer to sell them the codebase cheap ($5K-$10K)
3. Open-source the technology (get GitHub stars, portfolio piece)
4. Move on to next opportunity with lessons learned

---

## THE DECISION MATRIX

| Result | Commitments | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **STRONG GO** | 5+ | Continue, scale outreach, consider fundraising |
| **GO** | 3-4 | Continue, optimize playbook, bootstrap growth |
| **WEAK GO** | 2 | Continue but set new 90-day milestone, stay lean |
| **PIVOT** | 1-2 + insight | Adjust positioning/market, test new hypothesis |
| **NO-GO** | 0-1 | Shut down, document learnings, move on |

---

### Month 1 Targets
- [ ] 150 outreach messages sent
- [ ] 20-30 responses (13-20% response rate)
- [ ] 8-12 demos completed

---

## RED FLAGS & COURSE CORRECTIONS

### 🚩 Red Flag #1: Low Response Rate (<10%)

**Diagnosis:** Your messaging isn't resonating

**Fix:**
- A/B test different subject lines
- Change your hook (lead with pain, not solution)
- Get help writing better copy (ask a marketer friend)
- Try video messages instead of text (Loom)

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #2: Demos Booked But Not Showing Up

**Diagnosis:** Not qualified or not urgent enough

**Fix:**
- Send reminder 24 hours before
- Send reminder 1 hour before with Zoom link
- Call them if they don't show (shows you care)
- Ask qualifying questions before booking

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #3: "Interesting But..." After Every Demo

**Diagnosis:** Missing urgency or clear value prop

**Fix:**
- Change demo structure (show ROI first)
- Ask better questions: "What would make this a no-brainer for you?"
- Offer immediate pilot (remove friction)
- Show case study / social proof

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #4: "Too Expensive"

**Diagnosis:** Value not clear OR wrong customer

**Fix:**
- Show ROI calculation (saves $14K, costs $12K)
- Offer 50% discount for first 30 days
- Offer payment plan ($499/month instead of $999)
- OR: You're targeting companies that are too small

---

### 🚩 Red Flag #5: "We Need [Specific Feature]"

**Diagnosis:** Product gap OR they're not the right fit

**Fix:**
- If 5+ prospects say same thing → build that feature FAST
- If everyone wants different features → no clear market fit
- Offer custom development for paying customer

---

## THE MINDSET

### What to Expect

**Weeks 1-2:** Exciting (building, preparing, optimistic)
**Weeks 3-4:** Frustrating (low response rates, ghosting, rejections)
**Weeks 5-6:** Momentum building (demos happening, real conversations)
**Weeks 7-8:** Emotional rollercoaster (some yes, some no, uncertainty)
**Weeks 9-10:** Clarity emerging (patterns visible, sense of direction)
**Weeks 11-12:** Decision time (data tells you what to do)

### How to Stay Motivated

1. **Celebrate small wins:**
   - First response = win
   - First demo = win
   - First "this is interesting" = win
   - First objection (you're learning) = win

2. **Detach from outcome:**
   - You're testing a hypothesis, not proving you're smart
   - "No" is data, not personal rejection
   - Every conversation teaches you something

3. **Have an accountability buddy:**
   - Share your weekly metrics with someone
   - Schedule weekly check-ins
   - Someone who will call you out if you're slacking

4. **Remember the goal:**
   - You're not trying to build a $100M company in 90 days
   - You're testing: "Is there real demand?"
   - 3-5 commitments = proof of concept
   - That's ALL you need

---

## DECISION DAY: DAY 90

On Day 90, you sit down and answer these questions:

1. **How many commitments did I get?** ___
2. **Was the pain real?** (Did prospects resonate with the problem?)
3. **Was the solution compelling?** (Did they want it after seeing demo?)
4. **Was price the only blocker?** (Would they buy at lower price?)
5. **Do I have a clear path to 20 customers?** (Can I repeat what worked?)
6. **Am I excited to keep doing this?** (Honest gut check)

**If answers are mostly YES → KEEP GOING**
**If answers are mostly NO → SHUT IT DOWN**
**If answers are MIXED → PIVOT**

---

## POST-90-DAY OPTIONS

### If You Keep Going

**Next 90 Days:**
- Goal: 10 paying customers
- Strategy: Scale outreach, hire SDR, build requested features
- Metrics: $5K-$10K MRR

### If You Pivot

**Next 30 Days:**
- Goal: Reposition based on insights
- Strategy: Target new market OR new pain point OR new pricing
- Run mini-test (30 days) before full commit

### If You Shut Down

**Next 14 Days:**
- Document everything you learned
- Offer to sell codebase to interested prospects
- Open-source the tech (portfolio + goodwill)
- Network with everyone you talked to (stay in touch)
- Move on to next opportunity

**What you'll have:**
- Deep knowledge of warehouse operations market
- Proof you can build a SaaS product
- Sales skills (outreach, demos, closing)
- Real market insights (valuable for future ventures)
- Relationships with 20-30 warehouse managers

---

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

**This plan will be HARD.**

- You'll get rejected a lot
- Most people won't respond
- Some will ghost you after demos
- You'll question yourself weekly

**But it will also be CLARIFYING.**

- You'll know if this is worth pursuing
- You'll understand your market deeply
- You'll develop sales skills
- You'll have real data to make decisions

**90 days from now, you'll have NO REGRETS.**

Either you'll have proof this works (and momentum to keep building)...

Or you'll have proof it doesn't work (and permission to move on).

Both outcomes are wins. Uncertainty is the only loss.
