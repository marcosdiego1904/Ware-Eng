=== WAREHOUSE TEMPLATE ISSUE #10 ANALYSIS ===

PROBLEM: Incomplete USER_TESTF warehouse template creating cascade of rule failures

CURRENT STRUCTURE:
- Total: 311 locations
- STORAGE: 300 (all follow 01-01-XXXL pattern - single aisle, single rack only)
- RECEIVING: 7 
- DOCK: 1
- STAGING: 1  
- TRANSITIONAL: 2

ROOT CAUSES:
1. SINGLE RACK LIMITATION
   - Template only creates rack 01-01-XXX 
   - Missing racks 01-02, 01-03, 01-04, ..., 01-10
   - Users expect formats like 001B02 -> 01-02-001B (MISSING)
   - Users expect formats like 015C03 -> 01-03-015C (MISSING)

2. MISSING SPECIAL AREAS
   - RECV-01, RECV-02 likely missing (flagged as invalid in tests)
   - AISLE-02 confirmed missing (AISLE-01 exists, AISLE-02 doesn't)
   - Users expect these standard warehouse areas

IMPACT ON RULES:
- Rule 1 (Stagnant Pallets): Can't find RECV-01 pallets -> incomplete detection
- Rule 2 (Uncoordinated Lots): Can't classify RECV-01 as RECEIVING -> no stragglers found  
- Rule 4 (Invalid Locations): Correctly identifies missing locations as invalid
- Rule 5 (AISLE Stuck): Can't find AISLE-02 -> incomplete detection

USER EXPERIENCE IMPACT:
- Users upload natural formats (001B02, RECV-01, etc.)
- System converts formats correctly (location intelligence working)
- But converted formats don't exist in database -> flagged as "invalid"
- Forces users to guess which exact locations exist

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
1. Add multiple racks (01-01 through 01-10) to support user expectations
2. Add standard special areas (RECV-01, RECV-02, STAGE-01, STAGE-02, DOCK-01, DOCK-02)
3. Ensure AISLE-02 exists alongside AISLE-01
4. Create realistic warehouse layout that matches user expectations

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Location coverage: 42.9% -> 90%+ 
- Rule effectiveness: Significant improvement in Rules 1, 2, 4, 5
- User experience: Can use any natural location format without errors
